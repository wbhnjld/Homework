My name is Bohao Wang and i am in the CSC 453. i designed a ruby document called WangEnumerable.rb , which used module to handle those iterators. i used each method as iterator, with some external iterator and internal iterator.
Those iterators have been transfered into the Triple.rb document to test. All those iterators have been tested and got a good performance. You can run the Triple.rb to test those iterators.
